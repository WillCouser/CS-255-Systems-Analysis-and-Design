# CS-255-Systems-Analysis-and-Design
My repository for CS-255
This semester I worked on creating a business requirements document and a system design document.
I had a really difficute time keeping up with my workload this semester, since I have been working full time, 
taking 2 classes online, entering a busy holiday season with thanksgiving, a wedding, and various events to attend. 
Additionally, I have been working very hard to prepare for the arrival of my first child, a baby girl coming in January.
This change in my life was pretty detrimental to my ability to complete assignments on time, and I believe both of these items to be incomplete
I would very much like to revisit this sometime in the future to finish this repository.
